## 3411 Small Project
This project will includes the following
1. Calculating huffman encoding scheme
    a. Input: Array of probability, correspond to it's index.
    b. Output: A huffman encoding scheme for the input.
    Ultility function for the output
        getAverageLength(Huffman scheme): number
        getIndexEncoding(Huffman scheme, number index): string
2. Calculate extension for huffman code

## Project Plan
1. Finish essential functionality and store in src
2. Support terminal GUI
3. Support website
